### NOTE: Since this is a frontend project I did not use any backend technologies, otherwise, 
- The product fetching should be done with a database and API endpoints which would eiliminate redundant importing.
- Stripe integration requires a server for origin session request which is therefore not done here.

## Tech Stack

- React - frontend framework
